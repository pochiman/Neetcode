435. Non-overlapping Intervals

Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return 
the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals 
non-overlapping.

Note that intervals which only touch at a point are non-overlapping. 
For example, [1, 2] and [2, 3] are non-overlapping.



Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are 
non-overlapping.

Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals 
non-overlapping.

Example 3:

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already 
non-overlapping.
